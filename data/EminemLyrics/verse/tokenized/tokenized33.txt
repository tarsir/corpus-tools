i get lifted and spin til i'm half-twisted
feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick *smack
pen full of ink think sinful and rap sick shit
shrink pencil me in for my last visit
drink gin til my chin's full of splashed whiskers *whoosh
hash whiskey and ash til i slap bitches *smack
ask bizzy he's been here the past six years
mash with me you'll get in imagine this


[chorus]

i fucked my cousin in his asshole slit my mother's throat
guess who slim shady just signed to interscope
my little sister's birthday she'll remember me
for a gift i had ten of my boys take her virginity
*mmm mm mmm and bitches know me as a horny-ass freak
their mother wasn't raped i ate her pussy while she was sleep
pissy-drunk throwin up in the urinal you fuckin homo
that's what i said at my dad's funeral


[chorus]

that's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin idiots still still
that's why the first motherfucker poppin some shit he gets killed killed
that's why we don't call it detroit we call it amityville 'ville
you can get capped after just havin a cavity filled filled
ahahahaha that's why we're crowned the murder capital still still
this ain't detroit this is motherfuckin hamburger hill hill
we don't do drivebys we park in front of houses and shoot
and when the police come we fuckin shoot it out with them too
that's the mentality here here that's the reality here here
did i just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here huh
while i'm holdin a pistol with this many calibres here here
plus some registration that just made this shit valid this year year
cause once i snap i can't be held accountable for my actions
that's when accidents happen
when a thousand bullets come at your house
and collapse the foundation around you and they found you
and your family in it ahhhhh
got damnit he meant it when he tells you


[chorus]
