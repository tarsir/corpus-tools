yo some people say i'm whack now if that's right
i'm the freshest whack mc that you ever heard in your lifetime
my slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
boy i'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
forgot a gold digger's succubus  my souls thick with ruggedness
with the mic i'm like a dyke can't no nigga fuck with this
i got more different strokes than philip drummound
on open mic i bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming bitch
we elevated to new heights premeditated
let it be that i stated they hate it now that they see that i made it
the escalated can be put to the test of greatness
snatch the heart from mc's and i ate it
so i take it that's the reason i'm hated
to represent my temperment
if rap was a dick all you so called hard mc's would not be impitant
but pimping it and acting like you could rock a show so
harder than ll's rock the bells but you is a ho now
everything that you collaborate i lacerate
my rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
at a faster rate yeah i got something for your ass to hate
i blasterate and have you all running master gates
and as for face clutching and touching the flows
i got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
bucking these hoes i got that shit down to a science
leaving them hot and bothered turned on like an appliance
defiance no we won't have that
you want your shit to blow up
well i'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
and blast that shit to kingdom come
then bring them some of this real hip-hop
i drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
and you all knew from meeko
that you couldn't hold your own with the strength of lou forigno
so stop that bullshit and flow
yo you need to come with the real skills and act like you know

so what you know about a sweet mc in the 313
you don't know shit so when you see one flee
you can be run-d you'll never beat the mc
i'll stop the alphabet at s and got it down to a t
i'm sure your bound to agree a sweet mc crashes the spot
i'll make the roof hot like i was rock master scott
your ass forgot so just in case you don't remember me
i'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
it's either them or me man kill or be killed
you will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
my facilities filled with fans packed to capacity
i'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
if he's acting soft and he cowers
he better come cleaner then jay rue jacking off when he showers
you flowers got no clout with a thing
you could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
i showered the slang simple as a,b,c's
skip over the d's and rock the microphone with e's
dethrone mc's and i'ma max alone
relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
so facts are known writers get treated with shocks
i rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
i'm greeted with flocks of fellow follower's singers
you couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their
fingers
but you can bring yours let's see what you got
but don't front and never try to be what you're not
cause you can be quick jump the candlestick burn your back
and fuck jill on a hill but you still ain't jack
