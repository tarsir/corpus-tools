i've created a monster cause nobody wants to see marshall no more
they want shady i'm chopped liver huh
well if you want shady this is what i'll give ya
a little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
than a shock when i get shocked at the hospital
by the doctor when i'm not co-operating
when i'm rockin the table while he's operating hey
you waited this long now stop debating
cause i'm back i'm on the rag and ovu-lating
i know that you got a job ms cheney
but your husband's heart problem's complicating
so the fcc won't let me be
or let me be me so let me see
they try to shut me down on mtv
but it feels so empty without me
so come on and dip bum on your lips
fuck that cum on your lips and some on your tits
and get ready cause this shit's about to get heavy
i just settled all my lawsuits fuck you debbie


[chorus]

little hellions kids feelin rebellious
embarrassed their parents still listen to elvis
they start feelin like prisoners helpless
til someone comes along on a mission and yells bitch
a visionary vision of scary
could start a revolution pollutin the airwaves
a rebel so just let me revel and bask
in the fact that i got everyone kissin my ass *smak
and it's a disaster such a catastrophe
for you to see so damn much of my ass you asked for me
well i'm back na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
fix your bent antenna tune it in and then i'm gonna
enter in endin up under your skin like a splinter
the center of attention back for the winter
i'm interesting the best thing since wrestling
infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
testing attention please
feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
here's my ten cents my two cents is free
a nuisance who sent you sent for me


[chorus]

a-tisket a-tasket i go tit for tat with
anybody who's talkin this shit that shit
chris kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked
worse than them little limp bizkit bastards
and moby you can get stomped by obie
you thirty-six year old baldheaded fag blow me
you don't know me you're too old let go
it's over nobody listen to techno
now let's go just gimme the signal
i'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
i been dope suspenseful with a pencil
ever since prince turned himself into a symbol *knife slices
but sometimes the shit just seems
everybody only wants to discuss me
so this must mean i'm dis-gus-ting
but it's just me i'm just obscene
no i'm not the first king of controversy
i am the worst thing since elvis presley
to do black music so selfishly
and used it to get myself wealthy
hey there's a concept that works
twenty million other white rappers emerge
but no matter how many fish in the sea
it'll be so empty without me


[chorus]
