they call me superman
leap tall hoes in a single bound i'm single now
got no ring on this finger now
i'd never let another chick bring me down
in a relationship save it bitch
babysit you make me sick
superman ain't savin shit
girl you can jump on shady's dick
straight from the hip cut to the chase
i tell a muh'fuckin slut to her face
play no games say no names
ever since i broke up with what's-her-face
i'm a different man kiss my ass
kiss my lips bitch why ask
kiss my dick  get my cash
i'd rather have you whip my ass
don't put out i'll put you out
won't get out i'll push you out
puss blew out poppin shit
wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
am i too nice to buy you ice
bitch if you died wouldn't buy you life
what you tryin to be my new wife
what you mariah fly through twice


[chorus]

don't get me wrong  i love these hoes
it's no secret everybody knows
yeah we fucked bitch so what
that's about as far as your buddy goes
we'll be friends i'll call you again
i'll chase you around every bar you attend
never know what kind of car i'll be in
we'll see how much you'll be partyin then
you don't want that neither do i
i don't want to flip when i see you with guys
too much pride between you and i
not a jealous man but females lie
but i guess that's just what sluts do
how could it ever be just us two
i'd never love you enough to trust you
we just met and i just fucked you


[chorus]

first thing you say i'm not fazed
i hang around big stars all day
i don't see what the big deal is anyway
you're just plain old marshall to me
ooh yea girl run that game
hailie jade i love that name
love that tattoo  what's that say
rot in pieces uh that's great
first off you don't know marshall
at all so don't grow partial
that's ammo for my arsenal
i'll slap you off that bar stool *ahh
there goes another lawsuit
leave handprints all across you
good lordy whodi
you must be gone off that water bottle
you want what you can't have
ooh girl that's too damn bad
don't touch what you can't grab
end up with two backhands
put anthrax on a tampax
and slap you til you can't stand
girl you just blew your chance
don't mean to ruin your plans


[chorus]
