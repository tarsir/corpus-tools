alright stop
now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
and try to get money out the drawer
you better think of the consequence but who are you
i'm your motherfuckin conscience

that's nonsense
go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
and borrow a damn dress and one of her blonde wigs
tell her you need a place to stay
you'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with an aged razor blade

yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
the whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
think about it before you walk in the door first
look at the store clerk she's older than george burns

fuck that do that shit shoot that bitch
can you afford to blow this shit are you that rich
why you give a fuck if she dies are you that bitch
do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids

man don't do it it's not worth it to risk it you're right
not over this shit stop drop the biscuit i will
don't even listen to slim yo he's bad for you
you know what dre i don't like your attitude


[chorus]

now listen to me while you're kissin her cheek
and smearin her lipstick i slipped this in her drink
now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
yo this girl's only fifteen years old
you shouldn't take advantage of her that's not fair
yo look at her bush does it got hair uh huh
fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
man ain't you ever seen that one movie kids
no but i seen the porno with sundoobiest
shit you wanna get hauled off to jail
man fuck that hit that shit raw dawg and bail


[chorus]

alright calm down relax start breathin
fuck that shit you just caught this bitch cheatin
while you at work she's with some dude tryin to get off
fuck slittin her throat cut this bitch's head off

wait what if there's an explanation for this shit
what she tripped fell landed on his dick
alright shady maybe he's right grady
but think about the baby before you get all crazy

okay thought about it still wanna stab her
grab her by the throat get your daughter and kidnap her
that's what i did be smart don't be a retard
you gonna take advice from somebody who slapped dee barnes

what'chu say what's wrong didn't think i'd remember
i'ma kill you motherfucker

uhhh-aahh temper temper
mr dre mr n.w.a
mr ak comin straight outta compton y'all better make way
how in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent

cause he don't need to go the same route that i went
been there done that aw fuck it
what am i sayin shoot em both grady where's your gun at
