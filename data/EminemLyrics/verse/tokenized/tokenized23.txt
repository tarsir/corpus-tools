i don't speak i float in the air wrapped in a sheet
i'm not a real person i'm a ghost trapped in a beat
i translate when my voice is read through a sismograph
and a noise is bred picked up and transmitted through royce's head aahhh
trapped him in his room possessed him and hoist his bed
till the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
told him each one of his boys is dead
i asked him to come to the dark side he made a choice and said

who hard yo i done heard worse
we can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
to see which one'll swerve first
two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds
that of a globe on top of nine other planets
kissed the cheek of the devil
intelligence level is hell-ier than treble peakin on speakers in the ghetto
dismissal i'm not a fair man disgraced the race of a atheist
intercepting missles wit my bare hands like a patriot
one track sliced without swords i buried the christ corpse
in my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse
and stay over-worked its like the nazis in the nations
collaborating attemptin to take over the earth

cuz this is what happens when bad meets evil
we hit the trees till we look like vietnamese people
he's evil and i'm bad like steve segal
above the law cuz i don't agree wit police either shit me neither
we ain't eager to be legal
so please leave me wit the keys to your jeep eagle
i breathe ether in three amounts
when i stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
releasin rage on anybody in squeezing range
cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
he's insane no i'm not i just want to shoot up and i'm pissed off
cuz i can't find a decent vain

the disaster wit dreds
i'm bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough
to kill my soul after i'm dead
when in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
cuz i serve any stranger wit money
i spray a hundred man until they joint chains
while slippin bullets at point blank range like they was punches
piss on a flag and burn it murder you then come to your funeral
serve this lobbyist strangle your body then confirm you
whippin human ass throwin blows crackin jaws
wit my fists wrapped in gause dipped in glue and glass
i'm blazin mc's at the same time amazin mc's
somehow mc's ain't that eye-brow raisin to me
from all of angles of us flash a mack loud enough to cast a avalanche
and bust till volcanoes errupt

i used to be a loudmouth remember me
i'm the one who burned your house down
well i'm out now shit and this time i'm comin back to blow your house up
and i ain't gon leave you a window to jump out of
give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
and you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms
and when i go to hell and i'm gettin ready to leave
i'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe

cuz this is what happens when bad meets evil
and we hit the trees till we look like vietnamese people
he's evil and i'm bad like steve segal
against peaceful see you in hell for the sequel
we'll be waitin see you in hell
wall street royce da five-nine slim shady
see you in hell for the sequel bye bye
bad meets evil what till next time
