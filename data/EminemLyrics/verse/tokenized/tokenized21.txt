[chorus]

i hang with a bunch of hippies
and wacky tobacco planters
who swallow lit roaches
and light up like jack-o-lanterns
outsiders baby and we suing the courts
cuz we're dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source
they never should've booted me out of reform school
deformed fool,takin a shit in a warm pool
they threw me out the ramada inn
i said it wasn't me i got a twin oh my god its you not again
it all started when my mother took my bike away
cuz i murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
after that it was straight to the 40 ouncers
slappin teachers and jackin off in front of my counselors
class clown freshman dressed like les nessman
fuck the next lesson i'll past the test guessin
and all the other kids said eminem's a dishead
he'll never last the only class he'll pass is phys ed
may be true till i told this bitch in gym class
that she was too fat to swim laps she needed slim fast who me
yeah bitch you so big you walked into big tanny's and stepped on jenny craig
she picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
put me in the headlock then i thought of my guinea pig
i felt the evilness and started transformin rarrrr
it began storming i heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming
grabbed that bitch by her hair
drug her across the ground
and took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
sorry coach its too late to tell me stop
while i drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop


[chorus]

we drive around in million dollar sports cars
while little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
outsiders and we suing the courts
cuz we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source
hypercondriac hanging out at the laundromat
where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
dressed like a sailor standin by a pale of garbage
its almost dark and i'm still tryna nail a trailor park bitch
i met a slut and said what up its nice to meet ya
i'd like to treat ya to a faygo and a slice of pizza
but i'm broke as fuck and i don't get paid till the first of next month
but if you care to join me i was bout to roll this next blunt
but i aint got no weed no phillies or no papers
plus i'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
so gimme all your money
and don't try nothin funny
cuz you know your stinkin ass is too fat to try to outrun me
i went to grab my gun
thats when her ass put it on me
wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
i fell through the glass doors
started causin a scene
then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin machine
jumped up with a broken back
thank god i was smokin crack all day
and doped up off coke and smack
all i wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
now i wanna kill her
but so i gotta catch her first
ran through rally's parkin lot and took a shortcut
saw the house she ran up in
and shot her fuckin porch up
kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
looked around the room
thats when i seen the bedroom door shut
i know you're in there bitch i got my gun cocked
you might as well come out now
she said come in its unlocked
i walked in and all i smelled was liz claiborne
and seen her spread across the bed naked watchin gay porn
she said come her big boy lets get acquainted
i turned around to run twisted my ankle and sprained it
she came at me at full speed nothin could stop her
i shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
i started to beg no please let go
but she swallowed my fuckin leg whole like an egg roll
with one leg left now i'm hoppin around crippled
i grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
just trying to buy me some time then i remembered this magic trick
den den den den den den go go gadget dick
whipped that shit out and aint no doubt about it
it hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
i shouted now bitch lets see who gets the best
stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death ahh ahhh
come here bitch
come here
take this motherfuckin dick
bitch come here
