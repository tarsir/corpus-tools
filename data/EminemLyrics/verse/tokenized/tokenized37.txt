words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
that'll stab you in the head
whether you're a fag or lez
or the homosex hermaph or a trans-a-vest
pants or dress  hate fags the answer's yes
homophobic nah you're just heterophobic
starin at my jeans watchin my genitals bulgin ooh
that's my motherfuckin balls you'd better let go of em
they belong in my scrotum you'll never get hold of em
hey it's me versace
whoops somebody shot me
and i was just checkin the mail
get it checkin the male
how many records you expectin to sell
after your second lp sends you directly to jail
c'mon relax guy i like gay men
right ken give me an amen aaa-men
please lord this boy needs jesus
heal this child help us destroy these demons
oh and please send me a brand new car
and a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital
preacher preacher fifth grade teacher
you can't reach me my mom can't neither
you can't teach me a goddamn thing cause
i watch tv and comcast cable
and you ain't able to stop these thoughts
you can't stop me from toppin these charts
and you can't stop me from droppin each march
with a brand new cd for these fuckin retards
duhhh and to think it's just little ol me
mr don't give a fuck still won't leave


[chorus]

my mother did drugs  tar liquor cigarettes and speed
the baby came out  disfigured ligaments indeed
it was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
don't dare make fun of that baby cause that baby was me
i'm a criminal  an animal caged who turned crazed
but how the fuck you sposed to grow up when you weren't raised
so as i got older and i got a lot taller
my dick shrunk smaller but my balls got larger
i drink malt liquor to fuck you up quicker
than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin the word 
my morals went thhbbpp when the president got oral
sex in his oval office on top of his desk
off of his own employee
now don't ignore me you won't avoid me
you can't miss me i'm white blonde-haired
and my nose is pointy
i'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
in plane crashes and laughs
as long as it ain't happened to him
slim shady i'm as crazy as em
inem and kim combined  kch the maniac's in
replacin the doctor cause dre couldn't make it today
he's a little under the weather so i'm takin his place
mm-mm-mmm oh that's dre with an ak to his face
don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
i told you dre you should've kept that thang put away
i guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it eh
i'm a criminal


[chorus]

windows tinted on my ride when i drive in it
so when i rob a bank run out and just dive in it
so i'll be disguised in it
and if anybody identifies the guy in it
i'll hide for five minutes
come back shoot the eyewitness
fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
die bitches bastards brats pets
this puppy's lucky i didn't blast his ass yet *dog whines
if i ever gave a fuck i'd shave my nuts
tuck my dick inbetween my legs and cluck
you motherfuckin chickens ain't brave enough
to say the stuff i say so just tape it shut *tape unrolls
shit half the shit i say i just make it up
to make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
and if it's not a rapper that i make it as
i'ma be a fuckin rapist in a jason mask


[chorus]
