i'll have you taken back to christ when you sacrifice
the way you acting slice when i tear your back with knifes
jacking life's of mc's now i'm set to launch a plan
for blowing up the stage with illegal contraband
a stomped your man so unless you want what he got
you better set the mic down i'm steaming like a teapot
i'll make the tea hot people get in my face and ask
if i wanna battle then i chase them in a jason mask
it's an amazing task to battle with success
i never gave a fuck now i give a fuck less
and in a slug fest i get physical like physicians
invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
wicked wizardry like a sorcerer and no remorse for you
when i torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
so feel the force of my spiritual images
slicing up an enemy's appendages till he hemorrhages
my skin itches every time a rapper recites
and when he's through with his verse i'm all covered in flea bites
you wanna see fights i got a match for you
you couldn't flip shit playing in toilets with a spatula


[chorus]

you bitches get a hysterectomy disrespecting me
you wanna feel the full effect of me hand a tech to me
intellectually superior i'll make the whack wearier
inferior deterior rate like bacteria
materially killing serially clearly you'll see
how much in fear when u hear me you'll be
shiver and shake quiver and quake
bite a rhyme and rip it off then stiffer and ache whither and break
you slithering snake gibbering fake fibbering flake
i'll twist you into a different shape
and toss you in michigan lake for fisherman sake
if this is a dream you'd wish you can wake
every dis you can take personal
we ain't friends trying to make amends
if you ain't ever stole a gate you can take a fence
i make intense masterpieces and smash to pieces
your last releases you bad diseases that's the reason
i'm showing you the proper way to operate a mic
so pass it like a hot potato
i've never been less than clever and fresh
severing flesh of fools who never impressed i can confess


[chorus]
