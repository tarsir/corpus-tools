you bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest
more rawest form flow almost flawless
most hardest most honest known artist
chip off the old block but oh doc is back
looks like batman brought his own robin
oh god saddam's got his own laden
with his own private plane his own pilot
set to blow college dorm rooms doors off the hinges
oranges peach pears plums syringes
*chainsaw sound vroom vroom yeah here i come
i'm inches away from you dear fear none
hip-hop is in a state of nine-one-one so


[chorus]

quick gotta move fast gotta perform miracles
gee wilikers dre holy bat syllables
look at all the bullshit that goes on in gotham
when i'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals
so skip to your lou while i do what i do best
you ain't even impressed no more you're used to it
flows too wet nobody close to it
nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
the most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
in eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
they make it all up there's no such thing
like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
it just means so much more to so much more
people when you're rappin and you know what for
the show must go on so i'd like to welcome y'all
to marshall and andre's carnival c'mon now


[chorus]

it's just like old times the dynamic duo
two old friends why panic you already know
who's fully capable the two caped heroes
dial straight down the center eight-zero-zero
you can even call collect the most feared duet
since me and elton played career russian roulette
and never even see me blink or get to bustin a sweat
people steppin over people just to rush to the set
just to get to see an mc who breathes so freely
ease over these beats and be so breezy
jesus how can shit be so easy
how can one chandra be so levy
turn on these beats mc's don't see me
believe me bet and mtv
are gonna grieve when we leave dog fo sheezy
can't leave rap alone the game needs me
til we grow beards get weird and disappear
into the mountains  nothin but clowns down here
but we ain't fuckin around round here
yo dre whattup can i get hell hell yeah now


[chorus]

so there you have it folks marshall has come to save the day
back with his friend andre here to remind you that bullshit does not pay
because marshall and andre are here to stay
and never go away until our dying day
until we're old and grey marshall
so until next time friends same blonde hair same rap channel
good night everyone thank you for coming
your host for the evening marshall
oh heh
