where's my snare
i have no snare in my headphones  there you go
i have no snare in my headphones  there you go
i have no snare in my headphones  there you go
i have no snare in my headphones  there you go
yeah yo yo

have you ever been hated or discriminated against
i have i've been protested and demonstrated against
picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times
sick as the mind of the motherfuckin kid that's behind
all this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's explodin
tempers flarin from parents just blow em off and keep goin
not takin nothin from no one give em hell long as i'm breathin
keep kickin ass in the mornin and takin names in the evenin
leave em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
see they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out
look at me now i bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma
i'ma make you look so ridiculous now


[chorus]

ha i got some skeletons in my closet
and i don't know if no one knows it
so before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it
i'ma expose it i'll take you back to 73
before i ever had a multi-platinum sellin cd
i was a baby maybe i was just a couple of months
my faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
cause he split i wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
no i don't on second thought i just fuckin wished he would die
i look at hailie and i couldn't picture leavin her side
even if i hated kim i grit my teeth and i'd try
to make it work with her at least for hailie's sake
i maybe made some mistakes
but i'm only human but i'm man enough to face them today
what i did was stupid no doubt it was dumb
but the smartest shit i did was take the bullets outta that gun
cuz i'da killed him shit i woulda shot kim and them both
it's my life i'd like to welcome y'all to the eminem show


[chorus]

now i would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin
but put yourself in my position just try to envision
witnessin your momma poppin prescription pills in the kitchen
bitchin that someone's always goin throuh her purse and shit's missin
goin through public housin systems victim of munchausen's syndrome
my whole life i was made to believe i was sick when i wasn't
til i grew up now i blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach
doesn't it wasn't it the reason you made that cd for me ma
so you could try to justify the way you treated me ma
but guess what you're gettin older now and it's cold when your lonely
and nathan's growin up so quick he's gonna know that your phony
and hailie's gettin so big now you should see her she's beautiful
but you'll never see her  she won't even be at your funeral
see what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
bitch do your song  keep tellin yourself that you was a mom
but how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
you selfish bitch i hope you fuckin burn in hell for this shit
remember when ronnie died and you said you wished it was me
well guess what i am dead  dead to you as can be


[chorus]
