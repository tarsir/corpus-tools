whatever
dre just let it run
aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
aiyyo this song is for anyone fuck it
just shut up and listen aiyyo

i sit back with this pack of zig zags and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest mc on this  on this earth
and since birth i've been cursed with this curse to just curse
and just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
and it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensin these sentences
gettin this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest
and i rest again peacefully peacefully
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone when you freaks see me out
in the streets when i'm eatin or feedin my daughter
to not come and speak to me speak to me
i don't know you and no
i don't owe you a mo-therfuck-in thing
i'm not mr n'sync i'm not what your friends think
i'm not mr friendly i can be a prick
if you tempt me my tank is on empty is on empty
no patience is in me and if you offend me
i'm liftin you 10 feet liftin you 10 feet in the air
i don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you
go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit
i'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
i'm tired of all you of all you
i don't mean to be mean but that's all i can be is just me


[chorus]

sometimes i just feel like my father i hate to be bothered
with all of this nonsense it's constant
and oh it's his lyrical content 
 the song guilty conscience has gotten such rotten responses
and all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately
points a finger at me finger at me
so i point one back at em but not the index or pinkie
or the ring or the thumb it's the one you put up
when you don't give a fuck when you won't just put up
with the bullshit they pull cause they full of shit too
when a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school
and they blame it on marilyn on marilyn and the heroin
where were the parents at and look where it's at
middle america now it's a tragedy
now it's so sad to see an upper class ci-ty
havin this happenin this happenin
then attack eminem cause i rap this way rap this way
but i'm glad cause they feed me the fuel that i need for the fire
to burn and it's burnin and i have returned


[chorus]

i'm so sick and tired of bein admired
that i wish that i would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label and stop with the fables
i'm not gonna be able to top on my name is
and pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation
to cop me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
and i just do not got the patience got the patience
to deal with these cocky caucasians who think
i'm some wigger who just tries to be black cause i talk
with an accent and grab on my balls so they always keep askin
the same fuckin questions fuckin questions
what school did i go to what hood i grew up in
the why the who what when the where and the how
til i'm grabbin my hair and i'm tearin it out
cause they drivin me crazy drivin me crazy i can't take it
i'm racin i'm pacin i stand and i sit
and i'm thankful for ev-ery fan that i get
but i can't take a shit in the bathroom
without someone standin by it
no i won't sign your autograph
you can call me an asshole i'm glad


[chorus]
