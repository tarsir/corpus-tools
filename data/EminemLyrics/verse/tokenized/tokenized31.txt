yo you might see me joggin you might see me walkin
you might see me walkin a dead rottweiler dog
with it's head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
hollerin at him cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin
grrrr arf arf or leanin out a window with a cocked shotgun
drivin up the block in the car that they shot pac in
lookin for big's killers dressed in ridiculous
blue and red like i don't see what the big deal is
double barrel twelve gauge bigger than chris wallace
pissed off cause biggie and pac just missed all this
watchin all these cheap imitations get rich off em
and get dollars that shoulda been there's like they switched wallets
and amidst all this crist poppin and wristwatches
i had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
and walk around with an empty bottle of remi martin
startin shit like some 26-year-old skinny cartman "god damnit
i'm anti-backstreet and ricky martin
with instincts to kill n'sync don't get me started
these fuckin brats can't sing and britney's garbage
what's this bitch retarded gimme back my sixteen dollars
all i see is sissies in magazines smiling
whatever happened to whylin out and bein violent
whatever happened to catchin a good-ol fashioned
passionate ass-whoopin and gettin your shoes coat and your hat tooken
new kids on the block sucked a lot of dick
boy/girl groups make me sick
and i can't wait til i catch all you faggots in public
i'ma love it hahaha
vanilla ice don't like me uh-uh
said some shit in vibe to spite me yup
then went and dyed his hair just like me hehe
a bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
and run around screamin i don't care just bite me nah nah
i think i was put here to annoy the world
and destroy your little 4-year-old boy or girl
plus i was put here to put fear in faggots who spray faygo root beer
and call themselves clowns cause they look queer
faggot2dope and silent gay
claimin detroit when y'all live twenty miles away fuckin punks
and i don't wrestle i'll knock you fuckin faggots the fuck out
ask em about the club they was at when they snuck out
after they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
ahhh ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck blaow
look at y'all runnin your mouth again
when you ain't seen a fuckin mile road south of 10
and i don't need help from d-12 to beat up two females
in make-up who may try to scratch me with lee nails
slim anus you damn right slim anus
i don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots


[chorus]

is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me
you little groupie bitch get off me go fuck puffy
now because of this blonde mop that's on top
and this fucked up head that i've got i've gone pop
the underground just spunned around and did a 360
now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
oh he just did some shit with missy
so now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with mc get-bizzy
my fuckin bitch mom's suin for ten million
she must want a dollar for every pill i've been stealin
shit where the fuck you think i picked up the habit
all i had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
which is it bitch mrs briggs or ms mathers
it doesn't matter your attorney fred gibson's a faggot
talkin about i fabricated my past
he's just aggravated i won't ejaculate in his ass uhh
so tell me what the hell is a fella to do
for every million i make another relative sues
family fightin and fussin over who wants to invite me to supper
all the sudden i got 90 some cousins hey it's me
a half-brother and sister who never seen me
or even bothered to call me until they saw me on tv
now everybody's so happy and proud
i'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house
hey-hey and then to top it off i walked to the newsstand
to buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
skipped to the last page flipped right fast
and what do i see a picture of my big white ass
okay let me give you motherfuckers some help
uhh here  double xl double xl
now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
ahh fuck it i'll even buy a couple myself

chorus
