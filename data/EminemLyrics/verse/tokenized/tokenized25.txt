when i just a little baby boy
my momma used to tell me these crazy things
she used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
she used to tell me he hated me
but then i got a little bit older
and i realized she was the crazy one
but there was nothin i could do or say to try to change it
cause that's just the way she was
they said i can't rap about bein broke no more
they ain't say i can't rap about coke no more
slut you think i won't choke no whore
til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more
these motherfuckers are thinkin i'm playin
thinkin i'm sayin the shit cause i'm thinkin it just to be sayin it
put your hands down bitch i ain't gon shoot you
i'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you
shut up slut you're causin too much chaos
just bend over and take it like a slut okay ma
oh now he's raping his own mother abusing a whore
snorting coke and we gave him the rolling stone cover
you god damn right bitch and now it's too late
i'm triple platinum and tragedies happen in two states
i invented violence you vile venomous volatile bitches
vain vicadin vrinnn vrinnn vrinnn
texas chainsaw left his brains all
danglin from his neck while his head barely hangs on
blood guts guns cuts
knives lives wives nuns sluts


[chorus]

bitch i'ma kill you like a murder weapon i'ma conceal you
in a closet with mildew sheets pillows and film you
buck with me i been through hell shut the hell up
i'm tryin to develop these pictures of the devil to sell em
i ain't acid rap but i rap on acid
got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
whoops is that a subliminal hint no
just criminal intent to sodomize women again
eminem offend no eminem insult
and if you ever give in to him you give him an impulse
to do it again then if he does it again
you'll probably end up jumpin out of somethin up on the 10th
bitch i'ma kill you i ain't done this ain't the chorus
i ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
a bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
in a tub but that's normal ain't it norman
serial killer hidin murder material
in a cereal box on top of your stereo
here we go again we're out of our medicine
out of our minds and we want in yours let us in


[chorus]

eh-heh know why i say these things
cause lady's screams keep creepin in shady's dreams
and the way things seem i shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
this eighty g's a week to say the same things tweece
twice whatever i hate these things
fuck shots i hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
just to argue with em cause their ratings stink
fuck that i'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
from fat bitch to off seventy-thousand pounds of her
from principal to the student body and counselor
from in-school to before school to out of school
i don't even believe in breathin i'm leavin air in your lungs
just to hear you keep screamin for me to seep it
okay i'm ready to go play
i got the machete from o.j
i'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
you faggots keep eggin me on
til i have you at knifepoint then you beg me to stop
shut up give me your hands and feet
i said shut up when i'm talkin to you
you hear me answer me


[chorus]
