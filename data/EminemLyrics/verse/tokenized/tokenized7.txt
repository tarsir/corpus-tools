cause all i do is yearn a life without a concern
and dream of having a turn to earn money to burn
mapping out my strategies to get rich huh
my desire is like a scratch that needs to get itched huh
cause man i live in the d this shit ain't given for free
nothing's different to me so what it's easy to see
i'll be the prisoner to flee all of this misery
i'm not wishing to be another fish in the sea
but just an mc so listen to me but if you disagree
you missing the key you ain't even in the brisk of the tea
unconditionally my aspects to cash checks
my objects were never to swab decks
it's up to you the decision is yours
if what you vision is tours or a mission less course
when shit is in the stores cause you can be a star


[chorus]

yo i'm not about to chance it and dismiss handling business
i'm canceling christmas to gamble and risk this
financial interest is the matter at hand
i got an adequate plan for stab at a grand
i grab what i can and do what i must
pursue what i lust it's true that i just choose
the few that i trust thems the people that i still got
fuck with gangsta fill pot get your grill shot
the 5 elemantz for life my man thyme
proof kyu and denaun we move through into time
my crews true and divine we never fronted
we just wanted to be funded and live to be a hundred
instead of hunted or being wanted as fugitives
it's all about a man planning what his future is
what he can do for his to be a star


[chorus]
