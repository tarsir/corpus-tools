i went to john's rave with ron and dave
and met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
a nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
with first aid tape and raped on the first date
susan  an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin
who love booze and alternative music whattup
told me she was goin back into usin again nah
i said wait first try this hallucinogen
it's better than heroin henn the booze or the gin
c'mere let's go in here knocks on the door
who's in the den
it's me and kelly
my bad sorry let's try another room
i don't trust you
shut up slut chew up this mushroom
this'll help you get in touch with your roots
we'll get barefoot buttnaked and run in the woods
oh hell i might as well try em this party is so drab
oh dag

i ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag
huh


[chorus]

yo sue
get away from me i don't know you
oh shoot she's tripping
i need to go puke bleahh
i wasn't tryin to turn this into somethin major
i just wanted to make you appreciate nature
susan stop cryin i don't hate ya
the world's not against you i'm sorry your father raped you
so what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth
that ain't no reason to start wiggin and spaz out
she said

i said i'm high too bitch quit grabbin my t-shirt let go
would you calm down you're startin to scare me
she said
i'm twenty-six years old and i'm not married
i don't even have any kids and i can't cook
hello i'm over here sue hi you're talkin to the plant look
we need to get to a hospital fore it's too late
cause i never seen no-one eat as many shrooms as you ate


[chorus]

susan wait where you goin you better be careful
leave me alone dad i'm sick of gettin my hair pulled
i'm not your dad quit tryin to swallow your tongue
want some gum put down the scissors fore you do somethin dumb
i'll be right back just chill baby please
i gotta go find dave he's the one who gave me these
john where's dave at before i bash you
he's in the bathroom i think he's takin a crap dude
dave pull up your pants we need an ambulance
there's a girl upstairs talkin to plants
choppin her hair off and there's only two days left
of spring break how long do these things take to wear off
well it depends on how may you had
i took three she ate the other twenty-two caps
now she's upstairs cryin out her eyeballs drinkin lysol
she's gonna die dude
i know and it's my fault
my god


[chorus]
