i'm zonin off of one joint stoppin a limo
hopped in the window shoppin a demo at gunpoint
a lyricist without a clue what year is this
fuck a needle here's a sword bodypierce with this
livin amuk never givin a fuck
gimme the keys i'm drunk and i've never driven a truck
but i smoke dope in a cab
i'll stab you with the sharpest knife i can grab
come back the next week and re-open your scab yeah
a killer instinct runs in the blood
emptyin full clips and buryin guns in the mud
i've calmed down now  i was heavy once into drugs
i could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
my brain's gone my soul's worn and my spirit is torn
the rest of my body's still bein operated on
i'm ducked the fuck down while i'm writin this rhyme
cause i'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin this time


[chorus]

i walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
and cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue
i'll hang you til you dangle and chain you with both ankles
and pull you apart from both angles
i wanna crush your skull til your brains leaks out of your veins
and bust open like broken water mains
so tell saddam not to bother with makin another bomb
cause i'm crushin the whole world in my palm
got your girl on my arm and i'm armed with a firearm
so big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
buy your mom a shirt with a slim shady iron-on
and the pants to match "here momma try em on
i get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
a brain full of adverbs and a box full of laxatives
shittin on rappers causin hospital accidents
god help me before i commit some irresponsible acts again


[chorus]

i wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
spend a million a track and went over my budget ohh shit
now how in the fuck am i supposed to get out of debt
i can't rap anymore  i just murdered the alphabet
drug sickness got me doin some bugged twitches
i'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches
i don't rap to get the women  fuck bitches
give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
never ran with a click  i'm a posse
kamikaze strappin a motherfuckin bomb across me
from the second i was born my momma lost me
i'm a cross between manson esham and ozzy
i don't know why the fuck i'm here in the first place
my worst day on this earth was my first birthday
retarded what did that nurse say brain damage
fuck i was born during the earthquake


[chorus]
