i never woulda dreamed in a million years i'd see
so many motherfuckin people who feel like me
who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
it's like a fuckin army marchin in back of me
so many lives i touched so much anger aimed
in no particular direction just sprays and sprays
and straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
who woulda thought standin in this mirror bleachin my hair
with some peroxide reachin for a t-shirt to wear
that i would catapult to the forefront of rap like this
how could i predict my words would have an impact like this
i must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
cause congress keep tellin me i ain't causin nuthin but problems
and now they're sayin i'm in trouble with the government  i'm lovin it
i shoveled shit all my life and now i'm dumpin it on


[chorus]


[chorus]

see the problem is i speak to suburban kids
who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
whose moms probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
til i created so much motherfuckin turbulence
straight out the tube right into your living rooms i came
and kids flipped when they knew i was produced by dre
that's all it took and they were instantly hooked right in
and they connected with me too because i looked like them
that's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
searchin with a fine tooth comb it's like this rope
waitin to choke tightenin around my throat
watchin me while i write this like i don't like this nope
all i hear is lyrics lyrics constant controversy sponsors working
round the clock to try to stop my concerts early surely
hip-hop was never a problem in harlem only in boston
after it bothered the fathers of daughters startin to blossom
so now i'm catchin the flack from these activists when they raggin
actin like i'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say faggot shit
just look at me like i'm your closest pal
the posterchild the motherfuckin spokesman now for


[chorus]

so to the parents of america
i am the derringer aimed at little erica to attack her character
the ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
sent to lead the march right up to the steps of congress
and piss on the lawns of the white house
to burn the flag and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
to spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
fuck you ms cheney fuck you tipper gore
fuck you with the free-est of speech
this divided states of embarassment will allow me to have
fuck you
