yo never was a thug just infatuated with guns
never was a gangsta til i graduated to one
and got the rep of a villain for weapon concealin
took the image of a thug kept shit appealin
willin to stick out my neck for respect if it meant
life or death never live to regret what i said
when you're me people just want to see if it's true
if it's you what you say in your raps what you do
so they feel it's part of your obligation to fulfill
when they see you on the streets face to face are you for real
in confrontation ain't no conversation if you feel
you're in violation any hesitation'll get you killed
if you feel it kill it if you conceal it reveal it
being reasonable will leave you full of bullets
pull it squeeze it til it's empty tempt me push me pussies
i need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze


[chorus]

i love pissin you off it gets me off
like my lawyers when the fuckin judge lets me off
all you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
i'll violate and all the motherfuckin bets be off
i'm a lit fuse anything i do bitch it's news
pistol whippin motherfuckin bouncers six-two
who needs bullets as soon as i pull it you sweat bullets
an excellent method to get rid of the next bully
actually better cause instead of you murderin
you can hurt em and come back again and kick dirt at em
it's like pourin salt in the wounds assault and get sued
you can smell the lawsuits soon as i waltz in the room
everybody halts and stops calls the cops
all you see is bitches comin out their haltertops
runnin and duckin out the hot rocks parking lot
you'll all get shot whether it's your fault or not cause


[chorus]

i spit it slow so these kids know that i'm talkin to em
give it back to these damn critics and sock it to em
i'm like a thug with a little bit of pac influence
i spew it and look how i got you bitches rockin to it
you motherfuckers could never do it like i could do it
don't even try it you'll look stupid do not pursue it
don't ever in your life try to knock the truest
i spit the illest shit ever been dropped to two inch
so ticky-tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock
listen to the sound of kim as she licks on a cock
listen to the sound of me spillin my heart through this pen
motherfuckers know that i'll never be marshall again
full of controversy until i retire my jersey
til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
and lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
and put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity


[chorus]
