slim shady brain dead like jim brady
i'm a m80 you lil like that kim lady
i'm buzzin dirty dozen naughty rotten rhymer
cursin at you players worse than marty schottenheimer
you wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
you ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
admit it fuck it while we comin out in the open
i'm doin acid crack smack coke and smokin dope then
my name is marshall mathers i'm an alcoholic hi marshall
i have a disease and they don't know what to call it
better hide your wallet cause i'm comin up quick to strip your cash
bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
bitch i'm comin out swingin so fast it'll make your eyes spin
you gettin knocked the fuck out like mike tyson
the proof is in the puddin just ask the deshaun holton
i'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than ron goldman


[chorus]

i'm nicer than pete but i'm on a serch to crush a miilkbone
i'm everlast-ing i melt vanilla ice like silicone
i'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
i'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin
flavor with no seasonin this is the sneak preview
i'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
i'll make your freak leave you smell the folgers crystals
this is a lyrical combat gentlemen hold your pistols
but i form like voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
slim shady eminem was the old initials bye-bye
extortion snortin supportin abortion
pathological liar blowin shit out of proportion
the looniest zaniest spontaneous sporadic
impulsive thinker compulsive drinker addict
half animal half man
dumpin your dead body inside of a fuckin trash can
with more holes than an afghan


[chorus]

somebody let me out this limousine hey let me out
i'm a caged demon on stage screamin like rage against the machine
i'm convinced i'm a fiend shootin up while this record is spinnin
clinically brain dead i don't need a second opinion
fuck droppin the jewel i'm flippin the sacred treasure
i'll bite your motherfuckin style just to make it fresher
i can't take the pressure i'm sick of bitches
sick of naggin bosses bitchin while i'm washin dishes
in school i never said much too busy havin a headrush
doin too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
then i went to jim beam that's when my face grayed
went to gym in eighth grade raped the women's swim team
don't take me for a joke i'm no comedian
too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again
i'm goin up over the curb drivin on the median
finally made it home but i don't got the key to get in


[chorus]
