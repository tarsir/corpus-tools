hi kids do you like violence
wanna see me stick nine inch nails through each one of my eyelids
wanna copy me and do exactly like i did 
try cid and get fucked up worse that my life is
my brain's dead weight i'm tryin to get my head straight
but i can't figure out which spice girl i want to impregnate
and dr dre said slim shady you a basehead
uh-uhhh so why's your face red man you wasted
well since age twelve i've felt like i'm someone else
cause i hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
got pissed off and ripped pamela lee's tits off
and smacked her so hard i knocked her clothes backwards like kris kross
i smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
c'mere slut shady wait a minute that's my girl dog
i don't give a fuck god sent me to piss the world off


[chorus]

my english teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
thanks a lot next semester i'll be thirty-five
i smacked him in his face with an eraser chased him with a stapler
and stapled his nuts to a stack of papers
walked in the strip club had my jacket zipped up
flashed the bartender then stuck my dick in the tip cup
extraterrestrial runnin over pedestrians
in a spaceship while they screamin at me let's just be friends
ninety-nine percent of my life i was lied to
i just found out my mom does more dope than i do
i told her i'd grow up to be a famous rapper
make a record about doin drugs and name it after her
you know you blew up when the women rush your stands
and try to touch your hands like some screamin usher fans
this guy at white castle asked for my autograph
dude can i get your autograph
so i signed it dear dave thanks for the support asshole


[chorus]

stop the tape this kid needs to be locked away
dr dre don't just stand there operate
i'm not ready to leave it's too scary to die
i'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
huh yup am i comin or goin i can barely decide
i just drank a fifth of vodka  dare me to drive
all my life i was very deprived
i ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide
whoops clothes ripped like the incredible hulk
i spit when i talk i'll fuck anything that walks
when i was little i used to get so hungry i would throw fits
how you gonna breast feed me mom
you ain't got no tits
i lay awake and strap myself in the bed
put a bulleproof vest on and shoot myself in the head
i'm steamin mad
and by the way when you see my dad
tell him that i slit his throat in this dream i had


[chorus]
