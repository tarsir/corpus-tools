c'mon hai-hai we goin to the beach
grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
oh where's mama she's takin a little nap in the trunk
oh that smell whew da-da musta runned over a skunk
now i know what you're thinkin  it's kind of late to go swimmin
but you know your mama she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things and if she don't get her way she'll throw a fit
don't play with da-da's toy knife honey let go of it no
and don't look so upset why you actin bashful
don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle yeah
and mama said she wants to show how far she can float
and don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
it's just a little scratch  it don't hurt her was eatin
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
mama's messy isn't she we'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can pway by ourselves can't we


[chorus]

see honey there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
a place called prison and a place called jail
and da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
and you don't want a brother do ya nah
maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
i'll explain it to ya
but for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
she was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
but i still feel sad that i put her on time-out

ninety-seven bonnie and clyde me and my daughter


[chorus]

we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
baby don't cry honey don't get the wrong idea
mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear ma-maa
that's why you can't get her to wake but don't worry
da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
