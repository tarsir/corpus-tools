Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa-ohh!)
Somethin keeps pullin on my sleeve (Whoa-ohh!)
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa-ohh!)
These drugs really got ahold of me (Whoa-ohh!)
Cause every time I try to tell them, "No" (No-ohh!)
They won't let me ever let them go (Go-ohh!)
I'ma sucka all I gotta say (Whoa-ohh!)
is drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa-ohh!)
