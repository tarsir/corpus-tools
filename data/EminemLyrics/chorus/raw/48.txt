I know you want me baby, I think I want you too
(I think I love you baby) I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl, come be in Shady's world
I want to grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I want to save you girl, come be in Shady's world
(Ooh boy you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl
