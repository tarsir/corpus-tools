you see i'm just marshall mathers marshall mathers
i'm just a regular guy
i don't know why all the fuss about me fuss about me
nobody ever gave a fuck before
all they did was doubt me did was doubt me
now everybody wanna run they mouth
and try to take shots at me take shots at me
cause i'm just marshall mathers marshall mathers
i'm not a wrestler guy
i'll knock you out if you talk about me you talk about me
come and see me on the streets alone
if you assholes doubt me assholes doubt me
and if you wanna run your mouth
then come take your best shot at me your best shot at me
