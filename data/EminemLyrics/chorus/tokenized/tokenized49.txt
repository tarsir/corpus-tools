because sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
everyone's leanin on me
cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
but then she comes back to me
and now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
everyone's leanin on me
cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
nothing can take her from me
